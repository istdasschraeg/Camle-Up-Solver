Camel Board Game Simulator
Do U hate losing board games against ur friends and family?

Well, look no further. This program is here to help you dominate your next game night by simulating the board game thousands of times, revealing every possible outcome. Why use your brain when a computer can do all the heavy lifting?
Features

    🐫 Camel Movement: Simulates the movement of camels based on dice rolls and field effects.
    💾 Save and Load: Save the current game state and load it back whenever needed.
    💡 Strategic Insights: Recommends the best moves based on thousands of iterations.

How It Works

This program brute-forces its way to victory by simulating the game repeatedly until every potential outcome is calculated.
Forget about complex math — let the machine throw shit at a wall and see what sticks.

Recommended Settings

Run 10,000 iterations to get accurate probabilities. On my desktop, this takes about 2.3 seconds — lightning-fast camel calculations!
